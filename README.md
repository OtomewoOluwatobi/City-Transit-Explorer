## 📁 Dataset Source

We used publicly available GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) datasets for transit schedule and ridership data.

Recommended sources:
- [UK Transport Data (data.gov.uk)](https://data.gov.uk/dataset)
- [OpenMobilityData (Transitland)](https://transit.land/)
- [Google Transit Sample Feed](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/examples/gtfs-example)

## 🔍 Dataset Suggestions

Here are 3 starting datasets you can use:
1. **[TfL (Transport for London) Unified API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk/)** — Offers real-time and historical data.
2. **[OpenMobilityData GTFS feeds](https://transitfeeds.com/)** — Has structured GTFS datasets for various cities.
3. **[Data.gov.uk Transport section](https://data.gov.uk/dataset?topic=Transport)** — Great for CSV downloads.
